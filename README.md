## Homework 9

EmployeeSQL contains all the files for Module HW 9.

Under code, I have put all the queries under queries.sql where I put a comment to separate each query, as well as schema.sql which contains the schema. I've also put a drop_tables.sql in case you want to drop the tables.

hw9_ERD.png is the entity relationship diagram that I created, I created the physical diagram in this instance.

Under data, I put all the csvs that were used to import into the tables.
